## Implementation
We used AutoCode and ChatGPT, as well as JavaScript and Discord.js, to create our AI-powered Squash Bot which can answer questions regarding recycling and sustainability.

Our discord bot can provide information about recycling and sustainability. This can include the locations of the nearest recycling facilities, or what items are accepted in their city's recycling bins.
